## Solution


Inspect the HTML elements and recognize a single pixel image that has some odd behaviors
Either copy the javascript from the onclick into the browser console to execute it OR live edit the HTML to change the image size to make it more easily clickable, and click.  If you're pragmatically paranoid about executing unknown code, map the integers as Unicode characters either manually or via a script.
