# Potentially Eazzzy

This was intended to be a fairly straightforward constraint solving crackme.

Some of the constraints ended up less than straightforward, requiring use of
`z3.If` in my test solve. Still a decent constraint solving crackme I think

I've uploaded the challenge, along with my solve script.
